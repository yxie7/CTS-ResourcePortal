# CD - User Interface Part 2
Client Deliverable - User Interface - Part 2  is a full UI built in Visual Studio with Bootstrap

For this Client Deliverable, you will need to create ALL of the screens for your entire system.  **NOTE that requires a lot of planning and ITERATIVE work to have a quality, well designed UI.  The more work you do now on UI means substantially less rework for Capstone 2.  All of the CSS and Bootstrap homework assignments should be very helpful to you in completing this CD.**

Everyone looks at UI differently, and UI collaboration takes on many different forms.  However, it is mandatory that all team members fully participate in the UI development and that the UI is consistent across all screens.  Screen designs should be done professionally and all menu options, navigation, fields, flow need to be shown appropriately.  The screens should be displayed in a prototype format, where you can navigate from screen to screen.  The screen design and flow need to be clear and consistent.  Everything from your user stories, use cases and data model must be on your screens!   

**These screens are not just mock-ups in photoshop or something similar.**  They must be built in Visual Studio with Bootstrap, so that all you have to do next semester is start coding on the pages you have created.   Screens MUST use Responsive Design techniques.   You do not have the time in Capstone 2 to rebuild your entire UI, this is the UI that you will use next semester. If your system requires any other types of interfaces from other systems, these must also be included.

You will demo your interface to the class.  You will also give your client access  so that they can try the interface.

In your Canvas submission, you will submit a screenshot of all screen with text that defines the flow of the user experience (think: user stories). 
***For example:
The x user will use this screen to do A – B – C - after completion of this they will then be able to XXXX and run the XXXX report.***


# What to do

***Setup***
- Create a private git repo using the GitHub Classroom link provided in Canvas. 
    - Lock master branch (see previous Git homework)
    - Set ***minimum commit reviewer to 2***
- Use the Visual Studio template project provided
    
***Build a full UI in Visual Studio .*** 
- Create a Boostrap master page. 
- For each in screen the mockup:
    - Create a branch in git.
    - Implement a boostrap content page.  
    - Create a GitHub pull request from this branch, the the pull request description should include:  
        - The mockup UI image from part 1 of this CD. 
        - Most relevant user strories for this screen. 
    - Two reviewers have to review  the code before it is merged to master. 
     
***Deploy and report***   
- Deploy the UI on the servers you have used in CIS 3342. 
- Compile the report to be included in the final book and to be submitted in Canvas with this assignment.
